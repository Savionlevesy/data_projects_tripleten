# ðŸ›’ Superstore Returns Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to identify the **root causes of returned orders** at the Superstore and provide actionable insights for the CEO to reduce return volumes. Using Tableau, we developed an interactive dashboard and supporting story to guide decision-making across geography, time, product category, and customer behavior.
