# 📊 Zomato Restaurant Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Overview
This Business Intelligence project was developed as part of my onboarding assignment as a Junior Analyst at Zomato. The objective was to perform an in-depth **Restaurant Performance Analysis** using data provided by the company.

Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery service. The analysis focuses on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), restaurant trends, and actionable insights that can guide future business strategies.

## 📁 Data Sources

The dataset included 5 tables extracted from internal company systems:

- **restaurant.csv** – Information about restaurants (name, city, average rating, etc.)
- **orders.csv** – Order-level data including order ID, customer, restaurant, total cost, etc.
- **menu.csv** – Menu items offered by restaurants
- **food.csv** – Types of food and their categories
- **users.csv** – Information about customers

Data was cleaned, transformed, and joined primarily using Power BI for visualization and analysis.
