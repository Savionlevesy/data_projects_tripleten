# VentureInsight: Startup & Venture Capital Analytics

Welcome to my Sprint Project: **VentureInsight** – an auto-graded data analytics project simulating real-world tasks in a venture capital analytics environment. This project was part of my Business Intelligence Analyst training with TripleTen.

## 📊 Project Overview

As a new Data Analyst at **VentureInsight**, a leading research firm supporting venture capitalists and startup investors, I was assigned 10 auto-graded analysis tasks. These tasks leverage a newly acquired startup funding database to prepare insights for a quarterly investment report.

The goal was to extract meaningful patterns and trends from data related to companies, investors, funding rounds, and acquisitions.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

This project was powered by a relational database with the following key tables:

- **company**: Startup details including name, status, and total funding
- **fund**: Information about venture capital funds
- **funding_round**: Metadata on investment events and funding types
- **investment**: Join table linking investors to funding rounds
- **acquisition**: Records of acquired companies and acquisition prices
- **people**: Key individuals, including founders and investors
- **education**: Educational background of people listed in the people table

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying and joins across multiple tables
- Data exploration and filtering
- Analyzing startup ecosystems
- Uncovering investor patterns
- Interpreting venture capital metrics

## ✅ Example Tasks

Each task included a prompt and required correct SQL logic to pass auto-grading. Sample challenges included:

- Finding the most active venture capital investors
- Identifying acquisition trends by category
- Calculating average funding round amounts
- Tracking companies with high exit valuations
- Understanding the educational background of successful founders

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Investment insights can be deeply enhanced by cross-referencing education, funding behavior, and acquisition activity.
- The structure and relationships between startup, fund, and person data enable rich, multi-layered analysis.
- Efficient use of SQL subqueries, `JOIN`s, and filtering is critical for driving VC-related insights.
