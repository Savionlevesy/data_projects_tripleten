# Superstore Returns Analysis ðŸ“¦ðŸ“‰

## Overview
This project was created as part of the Business Intelligence Analyst (BIA) program. The goal was to analyze customer return behavior at the Superstore and provide actionable recommendations to reduce the number and cost of returned orders.

Using Tableau, this analysis explores patterns in return rates by category, region, time period, and customer behavior, ultimately helping stakeholders identify operational inefficiencies and high-risk segments.

## Business Challenge
The CEO of the Superstore is seeking clarity on why customers are returning products at such a high rate. The objective is to answer the following questions:

- What are the root causes of returned orders?
- Are there particular products, locations, or customer segments contributing more heavily to returns?
- How can this information be used to reduce return volume and financial loss?

---

## Key Findings

### ðŸ”¹ Return Rate by Product Category
- **Technology products** have the highest return rate, likely due to compatibility issues.
- **Furniture sub-categories**, such as **Chairs and Bookcases**, also show disproportionately high return rates.

### ðŸ”¹ Correlation Between Sales and Returns
- Return rates **do not always scale with sales** â€” some high-return items have moderate sales volumes, suggesting product-specific issues.

### ðŸ”¹ Geographic Patterns
- **Texas and California** exhibit the **highest return rates**, possibly tied to customer volume, shipping distances, or regional preferences.

### ðŸ”¹ Repeat Returners
- A **small group of customers** is responsible for a disproportionate number of returns.
- Customers with only one order were excluded from certain charts to better isolate chronic returners.

### ðŸ”¹ Seasonality
- Return rates fluctuate by month and region, indicating potential seasonal or promotional effects.

## Visuals and Story Design

This analysis includes:

- **Scatterplots**: Total sales vs. total returns by sub-category
- **Bar charts**: Return rates by category, sub-category, and region
- **Maps**: Geographic return concentrations
- **Stacked bars**: Composite analysis of return rate by region and sub-category
- **Filters**: Time, region, and product category for interactive exploration

The final story in Tableau guides the stakeholder through:

1. Summary of return behavior
2. Root cause analysis by category, geography, and customer
3. Dashboard usage instructions
4. Business recommendations and next steps

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- **Improve product descriptions** and expectations for high-return categories (Phones, Chairs, etc.)
- **Educate customers** or revise return policies in high-return regions like the South and West
- **Monitor return rates monthly** to detect spikes early
- **Empower regional managers** with dashboards to reduce returns proactively

## Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For dashboard development, data storytelling, and visual exploration
- **Excel / Google Sheets**: For preprocessing and exploring return data
- **PDF Report**: Final deliverable for stakeholders
